This program takes a string as input, and searches though every file in the 
current directory, as well as every sub-directory.  If the input string is 
found, the full path to the file that it was found in is printed out, as well 
as the line number the string was found on, and the line contents.  Nothing is 
printed out if the string is not found.  A requirement for this program was to 
utilize the fork() function.

This program was written for EECS 3540 - Operating Systems at the University 
of Toledo.
